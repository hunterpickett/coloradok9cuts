### Colorado K9 Cuts

coloradok9cuts.com

This project was created for my sister's dog grooming business in colorado springs. I wanted to try using Next.js because I was interested in statically rendered ReactJS. I additionally used my current favorite css framework, tailwind.css. It's served on an Amazon S3 server.

Future enhancements Include:
  SEO so people can find her through google
  Accessibility Improvements
  Serve it over HTTPS
