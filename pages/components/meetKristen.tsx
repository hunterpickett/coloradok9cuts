        Hello, my name is Kristen Nail and I have been grooming since 2010. I
        have always loved animals and I love that I get to work with them
        everyday. I have a Rhodesian Ridgeback named Tucker and a Mastiff /
        Boxer mix named Indy (yes, Indiana Jones). My goal as a groomer is to
        make both clients and their pets feel comfortable with the grooming
        process. My animals are my family, and as a groomer I treat my four
        legged clients as family too.
